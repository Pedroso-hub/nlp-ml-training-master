# NLP Training

This repository will introduce you to a series of exercises and tutorials.
The main goal here is to give you an initial perspective on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and most common processes that it involves.

The repository is subdivided into three folders.
Each folder contains one or more exercises/tutorials that you will be able to use to improve your knowledge about the techniques we will use.

### Requirements

In order to properly work on these exercises, it is recommended to create a python virtual environment.
To create it, use the following command:

```bash
    python3 -m venv env_name
```

Then, you can activate the environment using:

```bash
    source ./env_name/bin/activate
```

Once activated, install the libraries from the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) using:

```bash
    pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
