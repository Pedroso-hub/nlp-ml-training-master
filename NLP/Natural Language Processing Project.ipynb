    "In this notebook, you will apply what you have learned about natural language processing in a new dataset. As we could see, most of the time, when dealing with natural language, we can extract most of the features directly from text.\n",
    "Thus, it is up to us identifying what type of features are more interesting to use from the text.\n",
    "In this Project, you will work with a different dataset about fake and real news.\n",
    "Your goal is to have a classifier model that can identify when are fake or not.\n",

    "The dataset provides only the *title* and *text* of each news, from that, you can think on strategies on how to represent such text.\n",
    "Some interesting questions to answer are:\n",
    "1. Is the title more important than the rest of the text?\n",
    "2. If we combine both title and text as a single feature, does it improve training results?\n",
